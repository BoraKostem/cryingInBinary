<h1>Intro</h1>
The app is a web application that facilitates the appointment process for Bilkenters. Users can see the available appointments in advance and make an appointment through the application. Also, the appointments created by the secretary or users can be easily followed through the application. Since the previous health examinations are recorded, it offers the patient's health history to the access of the doctors and the patient. The main purpose of this application is to provide a control mechanism for the appointment process and prevent an unnecessary occupation of the health personnel. We have added features according to the requirements of the health centre to make the application more useful and practical. Students, faculty members and health centre staff are the targets for the application. The application is approachable since it offers different features for each user.
<br>


<h1>Actors</h1>
There are five actors in the health center management system. There are "patient", " doctor", "nurse", "secretary", "admin" actors. The patient actor includes the Bilkenters, who are not health centre staff. The doctor, nurse and secretary actors are health staff in Bilkent Health Center. The admin actor includes the developers.
<br>


<h1>Booking an Appointment</h1>
The secretary will be able to make appointments for each patient actor, but patients will be able to make appointments for themselves. Patients can cancel the appointment one day before. Only the secretary is authorised to cancel the appointment when the appointment day comes.
<br>

<h1>Patient’s Records</h1>
The doctor and the patient can view the patient's health history and profile information. 
<br>
<h1>Pre-Examination and Tests</h1>
After the patient comes to his appointment, the pre-examination information such as blood pressure and fever measurement will be added to the patient's health history by the nurse. Later, the doctor can request more tests when necessary, and the information obtained as a result of the test can be added to the patient's health history by the nurse or doctor. 
<br>
<h1>Notifications</h1>
An automatic email will be sent for a booking and upcoming appointments.
