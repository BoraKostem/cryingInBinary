<h1>Backend</h1>
The app is a web application that facilitates the appointment process for Bilkenters. Users can see the available appointments in advance and make an appointment through the application. Also, the appointments created by the secretary or users can be easily followed through the application. Since the previous health examinations are recorded, it offers the patient's health history to the access of the doctors and the patient. The main purpose of this application is to provide a control mechanism for the appointment process and prevent an unnecessary occupation of the health personnel. We have added features according to the requirements of the health centre to make the application more useful and practical. Students, faculty members and health centre staff are the targets for the application. The application is approachable since it offers different features for each user.
